# ATM
This emulator shows you how the ATM works normally.

According to the process, you can notice that this programme has properties like an original ATM. 
 The customer should go through the authorisation process step by step with the correct PIN. 
 After this, fill in in the amount required. Do not fill in zeros, as they are for a debit account. 
 The current balance will be shown at this stage.
 The customer can then check the balance of the account, print a receipt, or even reject or block the card. 
 Of course, as in real life, this cash machine has a limit for one transaction only. 
 If the amount entered is too high, and not available in that account, the smart ATM will ask the customer to restart the transaction.
 This programme is very popular nowadays, because it is practical to use the software, which has been written in java-language.

 So, if you would like to check the process,first of all download program, http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ - free version.
 After this, you will have the opportunity to open the CashPoint source for a demonstration in an iDEA application.
 You will need about 8-10 minutes for this. 
 Have fun !
 Please remember to leave some questions/queries and we will answer you immediately.
 Yours.
